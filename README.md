# Canon Cat UX Simulator

This is a web-based simulation of the Canon Cat's unique user interface, designed to recreate the keyboard-driven text editing experience that defined Jef Raskin’s vision of productivity.

The goal of this project is not to emulate the hardware, but to replicate the flow, style, and interaction model of the Canon Cat in a modern browser.

## Features

- Full-screen monospaced text buffer
- Keyboard-only interaction (no mouse required)
- Simulated LEAP forward/backward navigation
- Cut, copy, paste, and undo commands
- Auto-saving text to browser localStorage
- Retro boot-up animation
- Toggleable keyboard shortcut reference
